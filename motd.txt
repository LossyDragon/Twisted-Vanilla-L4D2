<h1>Hey! This server has minor changes to increase difficulty and improve quality of life.</h1>
<h1>(Why? Because Vanilla is boring and easy for some.)</h1>
<h2>Here are some notable changes to this server:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This server uses 96 tickrate, you can optimize your client by checking out the steam group.</li>
  <li><span style="color: yellow;">(CO-OP Only)</span> All spawns (Guns, Melee, Health, Upgrades) are removed in favor of spawning them randomly anywhere on the map, Tier 2 included. Look around properly! (Some maps have this feature disabled in favor of their unique design.)</li>
  <li>Weapons have been re-balanced and re-purposed with more unique aspects to them, details about this are on the steam group.</li>
  <li>Ammo piles are <span style="color: red;"><b>LIMITED</b></span> to one use and can be deployed by Special Ammo boxes.</li>
  <li>By entering "give_ammo" in the console while aiming at someone if you and them have the same weapon, your current magazine will be shared to their ammo reserve. This can be bound to a key.</li>
  <li>You can scavenge for ammo of the same weapon by pressing the use key.</li>
  <li>Laser sight upgrades are kept until death or if the weapon is manually dropped.</li>
  <li>Your secondary defines your incapacitated weapon.</li>
  <li>Special tier weapons can be refilled with ammo piles. Chainsaws can be refilled with red gas cans.</li>
  <li>Reload key can be used to give anything you hold besides weapons. This can also be used to pick/trade items from bots.</li>
  <li>Weapons can be switched mid-reload with the right timing based on stock animations. As soon as the magazine is in, weapons can be swapped.</li>
  <li>You can drop anything by saying <span style="color: LawnGreen;"><i>!drop</i></span> or <span style="color: LawnGreen;"><i>/drop</i></span>, this can be bound IE: <span style="color: LawnGreen;"><i>bind g "say /drop"</i></span></li>. Dropping your secondary will leave you vulnerable.
  <li><span style="color: yellow;">(CO-OP Only)</span> Say !join to show player management to join survivors or spectate. If you die while afk as survivor, you will be put in spectate and forced to rejoin dead for a respawn.</li>
  <li><span style="color: yellow;">(CO-OP Only)</span> Throwables can be used while incapacitated.</li>
  <li><span style="color: yellow;">(CO-OP Only)</span> Melees can be thrown with "+zoom" or by default middle mouse. This will leave you vulnerable while incapacitated or without a primary.</li>
  <li><span style="color: yellow;">(CO-OP Only)</span> Reaching a Saferoom below 50 Solid Health will grant 50 Solid Health on the next map.</li>
  <li><span style="color: yellow;">(CO-OP Only)</span> Mutant Tanks are enabled because regular tanks are too easy. See the Steam Group for more info on them.</li>
  <li>Use <span style="color: LawnGreen;"><i>!csm</i></span> or <span style="color: LawnGreen;"><i>/csm</i></span> in chat to change survivor, avoid using existing survivor models that aren't bots.</li>
  <li><span style="color: yellow;">(CO-OP Only)</span> Total of 4 survivors can join via matchmaking (8 if special lobby is used), steam group members can join up 16, difficulty increases by 25% per player (Tank Health/Common Count, SI count).</li>
  <li>Survivor rag dolls are restored, Defibrillators still work. Ragdolls may be disabled on certain custom maps.</li>
  <li>Friendly fire is <span style="color: red;"><b>REVERSED</b></span> back to you.</li>
  <li>Boomers and Bile jars affect everything. Boomers are also capable of putting out fire on special infected.</li>
  <li>Props that can be shot can also be set on fire manually by holding reload as they are being dropped while held.</li>
  <li><span style="color: yellow;">(Versus Only)</span> Hunters pounce damage is uncapped can can hit up to 100 based on the distance.</li>
  <li><span style="color: yellow;">(Versus Only)</span> Hunters and Smokers can release Survivors, if done they cannot attack for 2 seconds.</li>

</ul>
